## Learning Spark

I've created this repository with the purpose of learning spark. If I think it
is required I'll add more information here so I can remember whatever I need to
remember.

One thing very important about this repository is that I used 95% (or more), of [this](https://github.com/mvillarrealb/docker-spark-cluster) repository, so go there and check if you are browsing this repository.
